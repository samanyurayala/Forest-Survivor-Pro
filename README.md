Forest Survivor Pro
-------------------
Forest Survivor Pro is a game where you are stranded in a forest in the middle of the night and you must complete all the tasks shown on the top right of the screen to finish the game. Be careful for things lurking in the forest, which can come out at any moment and kill you. Also be careful for traps (Dynamite). 

How to play
-----------
Run around using WASD/Arrow Keys and Space to jump. Turn the camera around with the mouse. Explore the forest until you find something useful that can help you complete a task. There are 5 tasks you have to complete. Each time you complete a task, the next task will be displayed immediately in the place of the old task, so you'll have to pay attention to that.
